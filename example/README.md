You will need the same shared object binaries as when building
https://github.com/Timu5/bindbc-nuklear/tree/master/demo. This example
does not use static and dynamic configurations. BindBC is always used
in dynamic configuration.

You may also find the `sdlbindings.d` source file useful for other
purposes of using D with Nuklear. As of writing, the bindings are closer
to idiomatic D than in the BindBC example.
